                <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are <br> More In Need</h1>
                <p>The knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel happier
                    and
                    more
                    fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation and increased activity in the
                    area
                    of
                    the
                    brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give
                    than
                    to
                    receive.</p>
