            <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are <br> More In Need</h1>
            <p>The knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel happier
                and
                more
                fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation and increased activity in the
                area
                of
                the
                brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give
                than
                to
                receive.</p>
