                of
                the

                to
                receive.</p>

                <p>Hunger is still one the biggest - and most solvable - problems in the world. We have already made
                    incredible progress: there are 300 million fewer hungry people now than in the 90's. It is possible

                    according to 2019 estimates, 53 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries leave
                    primary school unable to read and understand a simple story.</p>

            <h2>They need us to survive</h2>
            <p>Around the world millions of children are found homeless, sleeping in the streets, under bridges, or on
                deserted properties. Their days are spent hustling by prostitution or petty crimes. They prey on each
                other as well as people passing by that they manage to steal from. Yet still this is home to these
                children, where they are deprived of the most basic human needs, housing, food, and clothing. Since they
                have no family or relatives and no hope for the future, they have been tagged “Nobody’s Children” or
                “Throw away Kids”, living each day as if it were the last, causing them to become outlaws, which as a
                result is a threat to the security of the community we live in.</p><br>
