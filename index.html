            <p class="describtion">The knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make
                you feel happier
                and
                more
                fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation and increased activity in the
                area
                of
                the
                brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give
                than
                to
                receive.</p>

                <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                <p>Hunger is still one the biggest - and most solvable - problems in the world. We have already made
                    incredible progress: there are 300 million fewer hungry people now than in the 90's. It is possible
                    to end hunger. But this work depends on the support of people like you.</p>

                    according to 2019 estimates, 53 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries leave
                    primary school unable to read and understand a simple story.</p>
